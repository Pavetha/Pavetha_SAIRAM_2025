'''Luke is daydreaming in Math class. He has a sheet of graph paper with  rows and  columns, and he imagines that there is an army base in each cell for a total of  bases. He wants to drop supplies at strategic points on the sheet, marking each drop point with a red dot. If a base contains at least one package inside or on top of its border fence, then it's considered to be supplied. For example:

Given  and , what's the minimum number of packages that Luke must drop to supply all of his bases?

Example

Packages can be dropped at the corner between cells (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1) to supply  bases. Another package can be dropped at a border between (0, 2) and (1, 2). This supplies all bases using  packages.
